#Study App


##Documentation
`GET /cards` returns a list of all flashcards

`POST /create-card` These are the properties and values they would take  
```
        {term: string,
        definition: string,}
```

##Summary
This study app allows users to learn terms and definitions using flashcards.  The terms are on the front of the card and the definitions are on the back. A user can hover over each card to flip it and reveal the definition.
